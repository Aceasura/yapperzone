        <p>Early Life

            Sylvain was born as the second son of Margrave Gautier in the Imperial Year 1160. He had one older brother, Miklan, though he was discarded when Sylvain's Crest was discovered. Miklan was jealous of Sylvain and attempted to kill him numerous times. Despite Miklan's aggressiveness towards him, Sylvain understood why his brother loathed him. He grew up with his childhood friends Dimitri, Felix, and Ingrid.
            Academy Phase

            Sylvain enrolls in Garreg Mach Monastery Officers Academy in Imperial Year 1180, and joins the Blue Lions.

            During the Verdant Rain Moon of 1180, Byleth's class is tasked with subduing a bandit group led by Sylvain's older brother Miklan, whom had stolen House Gautier's Hero's Relic, the Lance of Ruin. If Sylvain is being taught by Byleth, he can be among the forces confronting his brother. Should the two meet in battle, Miklan expresses his lifelong contempt for Sylvain inheriting the Crest of Gautier. <img src ="https://dl.glitter-graphics.com/pub/202/202249mfuthdkox2.gif">Sylvain retorts that it was never his fault that he inherited the Crest nor that their family effectively disowned him. He is horrified when his brother transforms into a Demonic Beast, but with the assistance of Byleth and his classmates, his brother is defeated. While he somewhat laments his fallen brother's death, he reclaims the Lance of Ruin. Back at the monastery, the Lance is given to Rhea in order to return to House Gautier.

            Alternatively, Byleth can refuse to give it to her as Sylvain has received permission by his father, Margrave Gautier, to keep the lance as its rightful wielder. Rhea bequeaths the lance to him under the condition that he uses it wisely in service to the Church and Monastery. </p>
