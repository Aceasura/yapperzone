<h3>Personality</h3>

Ness is seemingly nice and well mannered, smiling even if he is angry. However, he is an extremely loyal individual to his team, especially Michael Kaiser. Ness' loyalty to him is borderline obsessive: only caring about assisting Kaiser in his goal to become the number one striker. He is even willing to start fights with his teammates over their "disloyalty" to Kaiser. As the NGL goes on, Ness grows to hate Isagi due to Kaisers interest in the later.

When he was a child, Ness adored magic, as it could not be explained by conventional means. Being born into a family of scientists, his siblings and parents often ridiculed Ness for his sense of imagination, going as far as to call Ness an "idiot" to his face.

<h3>Abilities</h3> 

<h4>Archetype</h4>

<b>Dribbler:</b> Dribblers are players known for their close ball control ability that is used to go past defenders by sudden change of direction and acceleration sometimes combined with great pace. The skill is used to create opportunities for other attackers or to score themselves having broken through the opposition's defense using what is sometimes referred to as "trickery".
As the center midfielder and beating heart of Bastard München, Ness' ability to dribble and passes are heavily relied on as all of Kaiser's shots are started with Ness, and in turn, every Bastard Münchens play.

Skills

Flexible Dribbling: Ness' dribbling style is a mix of his hyper rational technique and flexible ankles. He uses his flexibility to easily feint the ball or switch directions away from his opponent in order to perform smooth and efficient plays with no wasted movements. Through the use of his dribbling, Ness is able to easily break past long defenders while maintaining a perfect distance for when a pass is needed. Another benefit to his flexible ankles is that he is easily able to snatch balls out of the air.
Key Passing: Along with his dribbling, Ness is also a very efficient passer. As the key passer for his team, his passes are always accurate and efficient, only serving to help the forwards score. Through his unique passes he allows Kaiser to get into the easiest position to score using the "Kaiser Impact".
Skyborn Daisy Cutter: A super clean pass between two defenders that hugs the ground while slowly rising up in the air. The pass is so perfect that it doesn't affect the speed of the player meant to receive it.
Illusion Cross: A pass that is supported by the numerous possible receivers all running around in what appears to be a very ineffective and random style, but in actuality, they are simply overlapping several passing courses that allows Ness to select the best passing course that would lead to the most beneficial result. His usual main target being Kaiser, who remains in the blind spot of several players, waiting to receive the pass the moment he steps outside of them.
Shield Flick: Ness uses his body to shield the ball from a defender and uses his flexible ankles to keep the ball just outside of the defenders stealing range. He then chips the ball with the back of his health, sending it flying into the air, where Kaiser can then chase after it to preform the "Kaiser Impact".
