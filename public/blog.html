        <p>Ness is seemingly nice and well mannered, smiling even if he is angry. However, he is an extremely loyal individual to his team, especially Michael Kaiser. Ness' loyalty to him is borderline obsessive: only caring about assisting Kaiser in his goal to become the number one striker. He is even willing to start fights with his teammates over their "disloyalty" to Kaiser. As the NGL goes on, Ness grows to hate Isagi due to Kaiser's interest in the latter.</p>
        <p>When he was a child, Ness adored magic, as it could not be explained by conventional means. Being born into a family of scientists, his siblings and parents often ridiculed Ness for his sense of imagination, going as far as to call Ness an "idiot" to his face.</p>
