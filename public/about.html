		<h2>Appearance</h2>

		Kaiser is a tall young man with blue eyes and blonde hair, accented by red eyeliner. His hairstyle includes a mullet with blue streaks at the ends and two deep blue rat-tails. He symbolizes blue rose tattoos on his neck, which transition into chain-like intertwined thorny stems down his left arm, culminating in a crown with a keyhole on his left hand. He is typically seen wearing his Bastard München #10 uniform, which features red and black with gold stripes, complemented by black and gold striped socks, sneakers, and a long-sleeved shirt.

		Personality

		Kaiser is shown as an arrogant young man who has a superiority complex. He sees everybody around him as merely small time actor compared to his big time main role as the star of his world. Though he is arrogant and slyly rude to people he sees as beneath him, he is not unnecessarily rude to his teammates but will put them in their place when they unnecessarily speak out even if it's for his sake. Even though Kaiser is arrogant and rude, he knows when to control himself around people who are definitively better and superior to him, such as his team leader and the best striker in the world, Noel Noa.

		After the match against the Ubers, Kaiser was immensely frustrated when he lost to Isagi a second time. Originally, he joined Bastard Munchen because it was the quickest way to get into Re Al, but now he cannot just leave the Neo Egoist League after losing to Isagi.

		Kaiser believes that the moment people believe things are impossible, they are programmed to give up. Those who sacrifice their talent in exchange for living long and tedious lives are the ones he hates the most.

		Before, Kaiser was a mentally weak person who constantly gave up on things he believed to be impossible. To remind himself to never again too fall into that weak mindset, he got a blue rose tattoo on his neck, which he believes symbolizes the achievement of the impossible.

		Abilities
		Archetype

			Clinical Finisher: Clinical finishers are forwards that specialize in their accurate shooting ability. They are "clinical", in that they need few opportunities to score a goal being able to strike and place the ball exactly where it will beat the goalkeeper. They can be identified by their high goal to shots ratio. Clinical strikers usually play as center forwards though other attacking players can often be said to be clinical finishers.

		With an omnipotent vision, high football IQ, the fastest kick speed in the world and a powerful shot to match, Kaiser is the ace scorer for Bastard München. Kaiser is easily able to get into an ideal scoring position, receive any kind of pass, and create space for himself when pressured by the opposition to score effortless and illogical goals.
		Skills

			Professional Football Technique: Kaiser is regarded as a genius player in the professional world of football. He plays football for one of the best teams in the world as the main striker. His skills are highly respected by teammates, opposing teams, club owners, investors, and even the best striker in the world. His skill and technique is so high level that his team's style of play and philosophy revolve around him and his style of play.

			Off-the-Ball Movements: A term used to describe the moments where players are not in possession of the ball.
			Kaiser uses these moments to position himself where he can always receive a pass, whether in his opponents’ or teammates' blind spots. When marked by a defender, Kaiser always runs towards the course most troublesome to his opposition and then immediately steps in the opposite direction of their center of gravity to bypass them finding an open position for himself.

			Metavision (超越視界 Meta Bijon?, Transcendence Sight): A term used to describe a player's evolved vision that gives them an omnipotent perspective of the field. Using his eyes to constantly take in information from his central and peripheral vision, Kaiser constantly collects data on every player, every play they make, and their positions on the field; mixed with his high football IQ, Kaiser is able to interpret that data and use it to heighten every move he makes to unpredictable levels and find opportunities before others can. This ability escapes the logic of even the most highly advanced football players. Mixed with his other abilities, Kaiser is able to dominate the field creating illogical opportunities born from his vision.

			Predator Eye: Described as a complete opposite of Metavision, instead of expanding his vision, Kaiser drastically narrows it down in order to score a goal. Kaiser uses Predator Eye to find the smallest of gaps for a shot course, when aiming and shooting his Kaiser Impact.

			Kaiser Impact (皇帝衝撃波 Kaizā Inpakuto?): With the fastest kick swing speed in the world, Kaiser will uses his god given talent to take a volley shot that is so fast most people aren't able to track the ball as it flies into the net. When used in tandem with his Metavision and Predator Eye, Kaiser is able to fearlessly score near impossible shots with extreme accuracy. His shot has the speed and power to pass by the heads of five defenders in front of the goal and the goalie with pinpoint accuracy into the goal.
				Kaiser Impact: Beinschuss: While in midair, Kaiser uses the Kaiser Impact in the form of a bicycle kick. The ball then nutmegs under a defender, bounces off the ground, and lands a goal without loosing any speed. "Beinschuss" means "nutmeg" in German.
				Kaiser Impact: Lightning Strike: Kaiser dribbles the ball forward, immediately taking a one-step cut to the side before shooting. This allows for him to temporarily throw off the defender's timing, giving him an opening.
				Kaiser Impact: Magnus: Unlike with the regular Kaiser Impact where he prioritizes kicking the ball straight, Kaiser will put some spin on the ball, making it curve while intentionally using the air valve to guide the ball towards the goal. For this shot to work, Kaiser needs to determine exactly where to strike the ball to up its accuracy to a level on par with a regular Kaiser Impact. The ball must also be stationary, raising the difficulty of the shot astronomically. During Bastards match against PXG, Kaiser attempted this shot with the ball in motion, but due to being surrounded by five defenders and not putting enough spin on the ball, the shot completely missed the goal. Kaiser succeeded in his next attempt due to Jin Kiyora sending him a pass with an extreme backspin, that resulted in the ball rolling to halt right before his feet.
